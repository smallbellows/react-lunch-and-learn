# react-lunch-and-learn
A quick-start react app for a dev team lunch and learn

Created for a small team of mostly back-end developers, some of whom had expressed interest in learning more about React. We were about to be starting on a massive project with a heavy front-end, so I put together a lunch&learn to introduce React concepts to the team. 

Not everyone on the team ended up working with React, but at least they have some concept of what I'm talking about in demos and code reviews now.
